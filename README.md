# FortisBC Biogas Plant Upgrade Project (FBPU)

This repository contains the working files for the **FortisBC Biogas Plant Upgrade Project**, an interdisciplinary engineering project run through **WEST (Women in Engineering, Science & Technology)** in collaboration with **FortisBC**.

The project focuses on designing, implementing, and validating upgrades to an existing renewable natural gas (RNG) facility, with emphasis on realistic industrial constraints, transient system behavior, and cross-disciplinary coordination.

---

## Project Overview

FortisBC operates a biogas upgrading facility that converts landfill gas into pipeline-quality renewable natural gas using pressure swing adsorption (PSA). As landfill gas production increases, the facility is approaching its original design limits.

This project explores a proposed plant upgrade that introduces:
- A revised process configuration
- Recycle gas compression
- Robust control strategies to handle transient operating conditions
- Integrated mechanical, electrical, civil, software, and project management design

The goal is not only to propose a solution, but to **demonstrate and validate system behavior** through simulation, modeling, and physical or virtual prototypes.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by subteam to support clear ownership and integration:


Each subteam is responsible for maintaining their section and ensuring files are clearly named and documented.

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository using **GitHub Desktop**
2. Ensure you are on the correct branch before making changes
3. Pull the latest updates before starting new work
4. Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages

If you are new to Git or GitHub Desktop, refer to the onboarding documentation provided during lectures.

---

## Working Guidelines

- This repository is the **single source of truth** for project files
- Avoid pushing incomplete or untested work to `main`
- Communicate changes that affect other subteams
- Keep documentation up to date as designs evolve

This project emphasizes good engineering practice, including version control, traceability, and clear communication across disciplines.

## Project Documentation

The full project memo and supporting materials can be found in the `docs/` directory.

Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the memo, as it defines:
- Project scope and constraints
- Technical expectations
- Subteam responsibilities
- Deliverables and validation requirements
